/**
 * NIST HL7 V2 Message Validation Web Service
 * <p>
 * This web service provides an interface for validating HL7 version 2 (V2)
 * message instances against a message profile and/or a validation context. The
 * interface is designed for use in a state-less web-service environment.
 * <p>
 * This service supports validation for HL7 Version 2.3.1, 2.4, 2.5, and 2.5.1.
 * The version that is used for validation is indicated by HL7 version specified
 * in the message profile.
 * <p>
 * Note that the validation can be performed against a profile, a validation
 * context, or both. One of these three options must be specified.

	/**
	 * Perform the message validation and return a report.
	 * <p>
	 * Message validation requires an HL7 v2 message encoded in ER7 or XML. The
	 * validation may also use a specification (i.e., an HL7 V2 conformance
	 * profile), a configuration file, and a validation context. The
	 * configuration file can specify HL7 table files that are to be used during
	 * the validation process. The validation context specifies specific content
	 * tests related to the message. The validation can be performed against a
	 * profile, a validation context, or both. One of these three options must
	 * be specified.
	 * <p>
	 * By default the validation service uses the HL7 V2 table file in
	 * validation for the corresponding version of the profile.
	 * <p>
	 * 
	 * @param message
	 *            the HL7 V2 message that is being validated. The encoding of
	 *            the message can be XML or ER7. The validation service
	 *            determines the encoding type by examining the content of the
	 *            message parameter.
	 *            <p>
	 * @param OID
	 *            the OID is a reference to the profile used in validation. The
	 *            OID must reference a valid HL7 V2 conformance profile that is
	 *            loaded on the server. The service requires that the profile is
	 *            pre-loaded in the repository and validated.
	 *            <p>
	 *            If a profile is not specified in this parameter, then the
	 *            value specified in the message in MSH.21 is used. If neither
	 *            is specified then the validation is performed against the
	 *            validation context only. If an OID is specified in both the
	 *            validate method call parameter and in MSH.21, then the
	 *            validate method call OID parameter will be used (i.e., the
	 *            method call parameter overrides the MSH.21 element).
	 *            <p>
	 * @param xmlConfig
	 *            is an XML document used to specify validation configuration
	 *            parameters. xmlConfig can contain the following attributes.
	 *            See xmlConfig for a detailed specification.
	 *            <p>
	 * 
	 *            <pre>
	 *   xmlMessage: a flag (true or false) that requests that the XML message representation of the
	 *   message be returned in the results report. This utility can be used to retrieve the XML encoding of a
	 *   message encoded in ER7. Note that the NIST validation service performs validation on the message in
	 *   the encoding that it receives. That is, it does not transform the message before validation.
	 * </pre>
	 *            <p>
	 *            additionalResources: indicates that additional resources are
	 *            used during validation. In HL7 V2 an additional resource can
	 *            be one or more table (i.e., value set) files. An HL7 V2 table
	 *            is identified by the HL7table element. HL7tables are used in
	 *            the order specified by the order element. The HL7table and
	 *            order elements are paired within the HL7resource element. If
	 *            not specified otherwise, the HL7 default table is always used
	 *            last in the validation process. To override this default, set
	 *            the order for the HL7DefaultTable to 0 (i.e., the
	 *            HL7DefaultTable will not be used). Below is an example of an
	 *            xmlConfig file for HL7 V2.
	 *            <p>
	 *            The HL7 table is referenced via an OID and must be loaded on
	 *            the server and validated. The table file must adhere to the
	 *            hl7V2TableLibarary.xsd schema.
